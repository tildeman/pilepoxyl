The entity Identifier must be valid - otherwise no file should be produced

The following properties require follow-up details:

	(+) Entity can be spawned using spawn eggs
		(*) This only shows up when Generate is set to Both alongside the checkbox
	(+) Generate with basic behaviors
		(*) This option inhibits follow-up behavior details
		(*) Custom behaviors are intended to be requested if this option is unchecked, but no implementation exists to do so

Entities can only be generated with basic behaviors - no custom behaviors yet

The generator always produces a file (to be sent through multipart, of course)
